<!-- Strings are immutable, which means they cannot be changed once created. For example, you might think that the following code changes the value of my_string into the string 'train', but this is not valid: 

Example Code
my_string = 'brain'
my_string[0] = 't'

Confirm that by using the bracket notation to access the first letter in text and try to change it into a character of your choice. You will see the ouput disappear and an error appear.

text = 'Hello World'
text[0] = 't'
