You can use the built-in function print() to print the output of your code on the terminal.

Functions are reusable code blocks that you can call, or invoke, to run their code when you need them. To call a function, you just need to write a pair of parentheses next to its name. You will learn more about functions very soon.

For now, go to a new line and add an empty call to the print() function. You should not see any output yet.


text = 'Hello World'
print()
