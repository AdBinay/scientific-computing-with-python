Variables can store values of different data types. 
You just assigned an integer value, but if you want to represent some text, you need to assign a string. 
Strings are sequences of characters enclosed by single or double quotes, but you cannot start a string with a single quote and end it with a double quote or vice versa:

Example Code:

string_1 = "I am a string"
string_2 = 'I am also a string'
string_3 = 'This is not valid"

Delete your number variable and its value. Then, declare another variable called text and assign the string 'Hello World' to this variable.

text = "Hello World"
