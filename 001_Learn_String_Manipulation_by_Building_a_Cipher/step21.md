<!-- As you can see from the output, 'h' is at index 7 in the alphabet string. Now you need to find the letter at index 7 plus the value of shift. For that, you can use the addition operator, +, in the same way you would use it for a mathematical addition.

Modify your shifted variable so that it stores the value of alphabet at index index + shift. -->

text = 'Hello World'
shift = 3
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
index = alphabet.find(text[0].lower())
print(index)
shifted = alphabet[index+shift]
print(shifted)
