<!-- Variables are an essential part of Python and any programming language. A variable is a name that references or points to an object. You can declare a variable by writing the variable name on the left side of the assignment operator = and specifying the value to assign to that variable on the right side of the assignment operator:

Example Code
variable_name = value
Create a variable called number and assign the value 5 to your new variable. -->
number = 5
