<!-- Each string character can be referenced by a numerical index. The index count starts at zero. So the first character of a string has an index of 0. For example, in the string 'Hello World', 'H' is at index 0, 'e' is at index 1, and so on.

Each character of a string can be accessed by using bracket notation. You need to write the variable name followed by square brackets and add the index of the character between the brackets:

Example Code
text = 'Hello World'
r = text[8]
Now, instead of printing text, print just the character at index 6. -->

text = 'Hello World'
print(text[6])
