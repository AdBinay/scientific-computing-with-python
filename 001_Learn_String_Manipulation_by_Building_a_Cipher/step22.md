<!-- Repeating the process of locating the letter inside the alphabet and determine the shifted letter for each character in text can be tedious. Thankfully, you can simplify it using a loop.

For now, remove all the lines of code below the declaration of the alphabet variable. -->

text = 'Hello World'
shift = 3
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
