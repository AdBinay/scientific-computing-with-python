<!-- Key aspects of variable naming in Python are:

Some words are reserved keywords (e.g. for, while, True). They have a special meaning in Python, so you cannot use them for variable names.
Variable names cannot start with a number, and they can only contain alpha-numeric characters or underscores.
Variable names are case sensitive, i.e. my_var is different from my_Var and MY_VAR.
Finally, it is a common convention to write variable names using snake_case, where each space is replaced by an underscore character and the words are written in lowercase letters.
Remove both calls to print() and declare another variable called alphabet. Assign the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' to this variable. -->

text = 'Hello World'
shift = 3
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
